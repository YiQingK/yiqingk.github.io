                            <p class="mb-0">We worked together to create a basic idea of what we had in mind, sharing the different features we think should be included in the screen.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">These features included:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="mb-0 list-item">Allowing the users to see the progress of the meeting as well as the participants that are already on the call</li>

                            <p class="mb-0">After having a classmate evaluate our low fidelity, some areas of improvement were brought to our attention which include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="mb-0 list-item">Splitting the host and participants as columns is not viable if the host has a long name causing the name to be potentially cut-off</li>
                                <li class="mb-0 list-item">Red dot symbolizing the recording status of the meeting is not visible enough</li>
                                <li class="mb-0 list-item">Icons in the middle of the example video feed might obstruct something</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mb-0">Therefore, we made the appropriate changes for our first version of the high fidelity.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">The only change made from the wireframe is how we divided the host and the call participants. We felt that just stating the nunmber of people in the call might be confusing to users as it whether the number includes the host(s).</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Therefore, we decided to specifically state the number excluding the host and shifting the number to be above the 'other' participants. </p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Other than the aesthetic changes which were to include Zoom colors, we decided to change the toggle of the pronouns to a switch instead of the eye. Users not familiar with its conventions might find it confusing as it whether it is visible or not.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">After receiving a final user testing feedback from another classmate, we made our final changes which included</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="mb-0 list-item">Adding the word 'Host' before the host name - Making the host more obvious as it was not clear why there was one participant that was separated from the others.</li>
                                <li class="mb-0 list-item">Adding an underline for 'show more' - Making it more obvious it is clickable</li>
                                <li class="mb-0 list-item">Changing the color of the settings icon and adding a translucent bar on the top of the video feed - Making the settings icon more obvious</li>
                            </ul>

    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="list-item" style="font-weight: bold">Figuring what how to solve identified issues in a single screen</li>
        <p>Our team struggled a bit on how we can create a comprehensive screen that allows us to address certain issues that we had identified in the initial categorical evaluation.
        As we had many ideas on how an issue is solved on a screen of its own, we wanted to create a prototype where it was able to solve 2 in 1 so that we are able to focus more time on a single screen rather than 2.</p>
        <li class="list-item" style="font-weight: bold">Unclear purpose of prototype</li>
        <p>As this intermediate screen is something completely new, it was not entirely intuitive to the test users as to what it was for. We discovered that showing the initial action of linking on the invite link and being immediately put into the call allowed users to fully understand what this newly created screen is for as well as its purpose.</p>
    </ul>



    <h3>Further work on...</h3>
    <ul><li class="list-item" style="font-weight: bold">More usability testing and observing a larger number of responses to the proposed intermediary screen</li></ul>
        <p>This will allow for us to have a better understanding of the pain points of the design as well as</p>
        <ul><li class="list-item" style="font-weight: bold">Creating another interface for 'seminar' setting</li></ul>
        <p>This interface was designed with the assumption the user was entering a normal call and we did not consider how the interface would differ if it were a seminar.
            As seminars have a much larger number of participants in a call, features like showing every participant may not be necessary.
            Therefore, I think looking into creating another interface for a seminar would be useful as well.
