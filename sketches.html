    <h1>Sketches <span style="font-size: 18px">UCSC HCI-201</span></h1>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">These sketches were one of my favourite ones from the course of the Fall'22 class of HCI-201 at UCSC.</p>
    <div class="row" style="justify-content:space-around;">
        <img src="img/sketch1.jpg" class="col-4" style="border:1px solid black">
        <div class="col-7">
            <p>This idea was inspired by my routine of brewing pour-over coffee every morning.
                I wanted to design an application that allowed coffee enjoyers or people new to coffee brewing to be able to try out new methods easily. This is assuming they have access to the equipment.</p>
            <p>I decided to include icons of how the apparatus looks like along with their names in case new brewers do not know the exact name of the method.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="row" style="justify-content:space-around; padding-top: 50px">
        <div class="col-7">
            <p>This idea was inspired when I thought it was wasteful when I was using post-it notes for ideation or note-taking. I wanted to create a product that was a more sustainable version of post-it notes.</p>
            <p>I am aware of electronic versions of post-its like miro or even sticky notes on the macbook however, I wanted something that was physical and can be seen around my room.</p>
            <p>As users might want to add additional notes to the post-it, the display screen is designed to be made out of glass which allows for users to use whiteboard markers to make annotations.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="img/sketch2.jpg" class="col-4" style="border:1px solid black">
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="justify-content:space-around; padding-top: 50px">
        <img src="img/sketch3.jpg" class="col-4" style="border:1px solid black">
        <div class="col-7">
        <p>I was inspired by my troubles when drawing on the ipad or sketching. There were many pictures I was referencing, but I had to keep switching between images in my photo gallery.</p>
            <p>I wanted to create a software that allows for me to view all reference pictures in one place.</p>
            <p>I added a text feature and pencil feature to allow for me to make annotations and also to possibly circle certain areas of a picture I want to focus in on.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p style="padding-top: 25px">Throughout the 8 weeks of making these sketches, I really learned to think about my surroundings' objects/interfaces. It also caused me to think about how I can improve my routine or current process of doing things. This has also inspired to keep looking into my daily life and hopefully I can make some changes in the future. I would like to futher work on these by making some lo-fi or hi-fi prototypes.</p>
