  <h1>Work Scheduling App</h1>
  <h4>Capstone Project at University of San Francisco</h4>
	<div class="row">
	<div class="col-8">
      <p>This was a capstone project done in my final semester at USF sponsored by SF Dev Shop.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Project length:</span> ~3 months</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Team members:</span> 4 (Kai BurkHolder, Gordon Mai, Serena Villenueva, Yi Qing Khoo(me))</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Problem:</span> Current work scheduling system is not easy to use and is only available via website.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Goal:</span> To create an improved form of our sponsor's current work scheduling system.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Results:</span> Created an easy to use cross-platform mobile application to help organise a company's work schedule. The app was created using React Native for a cross-platform UI which communicates with a back-end service built with Node.js and PostgreSQL.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">My main role:</span> 1 of 2 members in-charge of frontend development</p>

      <li class="list-item">Implemented stripe to the application for monetary processing of subscription, both frontend and backend</li>
      <li class="list-item">Implemented a clock-in clock-out system for employees</li>

	<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
		<p>It was the team’s first time creating an app so we had abit of trouble creating a workflow for the different users (manager & employee) when we had just started. We had the requirements of the app such as (a manager adding a shift or employees giving up a shift) but were unsure of how they would reach their goals. </p>
		<p>As we were building it, we were able to workout how users would navigate the application to reach their goals. As it was our first time, it seems a hand-on experience was the most effective way to understand how to create a workflow/ how a workflow would work. </p>

    <img class="col-4" src="img/manager.jpg" style="height:min-content;">
  </div>
		
  <h3>Further work on...</h3>
  <p>If there was more time, it would be nice to do some usability testing with the users as the only people that had interacted with the app were the team. The potential users may have a different opinions on some flow of the operations which could help us to improve the application. 
  </p><p>
  Going off the previous point, it would also be nice to have the users involved in the design. We could have understood what the users wanted as we were basing our app off the requirements given by our sponsor. 
  </p><p>
  Having more time, I would have liked to improve the UI design. Developing this app, we were more focused on functionality. I would like to improve the interface especially for the ‘requests/open shifts’ tab and ‘manage subscription’ page. The designs were very basic and similar. </p>
